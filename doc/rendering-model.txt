The rendering model (X classes) store the data in a printable friendly format.
The most important classes from the model are:
- DataGridX
- ColumnX
- RowX : IItemX
- SeparatorX : IItemX


While items (SeparatorX and RowX) are added to the DataGridX:

- The preferred size for each cell is calculated.
	- The preferred size is the size of the cell when no specific width or height are imposed.
	- The preferred size include the content size and paddings (left, top, right, bottom).

- The preferred size for each entire item added to the grid is calculated:
	- The preferred size of a SeparatorX item is the minimum size; when cells have no content.
		- Only the paddings and vertical borders contribute to its preferred width.
		- The height is always 1.
	- The preferred size of a RowX item is the minimum size that accommodate all the cells at their preferred sizes and also the vertical borders, if visible.

- The preferred width of each column is calculated:
	- The width of each column is increased so that it accommodate all the cells displayed on that column.
	- The column's min and max widths are honored at this step.
	- The cells that span across multiple columns are ignored for the time being.
	- The grid's min and max widths are ignored for the time being.

After all the items are added:

- The columns' width are recalculated to accommodate:
	- cells that span across multiple columns;
	- grid's min and max widths.
	- Note: The column's min and max widths are still honored.
