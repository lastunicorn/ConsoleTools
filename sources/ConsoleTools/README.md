# Console Tools

A set of tools and "controls" for the .net Console. They help displaying and reading data to/from the user.

_**Note**: Until reaching the version 1.0.0 the controls may change dramatically and will not ensure backwards compatibility._


## Bugs and feature requests

Please add a **[new issue](https://github.com/lastunicorn/ConsoleTools/issues/new/choose)** if:
- you found a bug;
- you see an improvement that can be done;
- you think of a control that is cool to add.


## Most cool controls
There is a data grid control that can display tabular data, there is a progress bar, a spinner, menus, etc.

All controls have configurable top and bottom margins and paddings.
